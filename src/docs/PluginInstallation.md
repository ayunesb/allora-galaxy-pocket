## What the Module Does

The Plugin Installation module handles the secure installation, configuration, and management of plugins within the Allora OS platform. It ensures that plugins are correctly associated with the current tenant, tracks usage, and provides appropriate user feedback.

Key features:
- Secure plugin installation with tenant isolation
- Plugin configuration management
- Installation logging and tracking
- Error handling and user notifications
- Permission-based access control

## How to Test

1. Navigate to the Plugin Marketplace
2. Attempt to install a plugin and verify:
   - The plugin appears in the tenant's installed plugins list
   - A default configuration is created
   - Installation is logged
   - Success notification is shown
3. Try to disable the plugin and verify:
   - The plugin is marked as disabled
   - The action is logged
   - Success notification is shown
4. Test security by:
   - Creating multiple tenants and verifying plugins don't leak across tenants
   - Checking that users without proper permissions cannot install plugins

## Linked Supabase Tables

- `tenant_plugins`: Stores the association between tenants and installed plugins
- `tenant_plugin_configs`: Stores plugin-specific configuration data
- `plugin_usage_logs`: Tracks plugin installation and usage events
- `system_logs`: Records plugin installation and configuration events

## Known Limitations

- No bulk installation option for multiple plugins
- Limited error recovery for partially installed plugins
- Plugin dependencies are not automatically managed
- Configuration settings require manual setup after installation

## Security Considerations

- All plugin operations include tenant ID verification to prevent cross-tenant access
- Row-Level Security (RLS) ensures users can only access their own tenant's plugins
- Plugin installation events are logged for audit purposes
