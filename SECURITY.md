## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously at Allora OS.

If you discover a vulnerability in the application, our APIs, Supabase configurations, or any dependency, please responsibly disclose it by contacting:

- Email: security@all-or-a.online
- GitHub Issues: Open a "Security" labeled private issue (if available)

We will investigate any credible reports and fix validated issues as soon as possible.

## Current Best Practices Implemented

- âœ… Strict Role Level Security (RLS) enforced on all database tables
- âœ… Supabase JWT tenant validation for multi-tenant isolation
- âœ… Security-definer functions to prevent RLS recursion
- âœ… Hardened Vite Development Server (`fs.strict = true`)
- âœ… Up-to-date dependency management (vite, esbuild, nanoid patched)
- âœ… Secure ID generation (`crypto.randomUUID()` used where applicable)
- âœ… Error fallback and loading states across all major app flows
- âœ… Regular Lighthouse audits for accessibility and security
- âœ… Periodic npm audit and dependency vulnerability scanning
- âœ… Production builds verified free of known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)

---

## Supported Versions

- Active support for latest production version (`main` branch)

## Disclosure Timeline
